# About Me
I've been in the product managment domain for over 15 years and have spent the last 5 years in digital products lifecycle management.
My interesting in *coding* was sparked from my working closely with dev & engineering teams to design, build, and deliver product features.
**This is my first time getting stuck into the bolts & nuts of coding!.**

## My Coding Journey
I'm currently on a 16 weeks coding bootcamp, to upskill myself on a few programming languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python).
It has been a thrilling and challenging experince so far - and I'm looking forward to leveraging GitHUb ecosystem to build network that will add value to my efforts to upskill my coding capabilities. 

### What I'm Working On
Some task I've delivered on my bootcamp include:
* Design a periodic table.
* Design a webpage with my CV.

#### Fun Fact
1. I've worked with teams across all continents (bar Antartica!).
2. At age 7, I smashed the family TV to see how the inside workings of a TV - *wasn't a smart move!*
3. I like football - and support Chelsea FC.
